# React Food Ordering Application :

# Q&A:

- # Q: What is Higher Order Component ?

  - Ans: A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is an advanced pattern in React where a function takes a component and returns a new component with extended or modified functionality. It's a way to enhance or reuse component logic by wrapping components in another component.

  HOCs themselves are not part of the React API; they're a pattern that emerges from the compositional nature of React components and JavaScript's functional programming features.

  `Here's how you create and use a Higher-Order Component:`

  ```js
  import React from "react";
  const withHOC = (WrappedComponent) => {
    class HOC extends React.Component {
      // Add additional functionality here
      render() {
        return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
      }
    }

    return HOC;
  };
  ```

## Managing Data Effectively with Higher Order Components :

- # Step 1: Implement Promoted level:

- We will use Higher Order Component to create a promoted level on top of Restaurant card component.

- From the fetched data, we will use isPromoted property to check if the restaurant is promoted or not. If it is promoted, we will add a promoted level on top of the restaurant card. If it is not promoted, we will just render the restaurant card.
  `Input = RestaurantCard ==> Output = PromotedRestaurantCard`

```js
const withPromotedLabel = (RestaurantCard) => {
  return () => {
    return (
      <div className="relative">
        <div className="absolute top-0 left-0 bg-rose-500 text-white p-1 rounded-br-md text-xs">
          <span>Promoted</span>
        </div>
        <RestaurantCard />
      </div>
    );
  };
};
```

- So what is happening here? We are creating a Higher Order Component called withPromotedLabel. It takes a component as an argument and returns a new component. The new component renders the component that is passed as an argument. In our case, it is RestaurantCard. We are also adding a promoted level on top of the RestaurantCard component.

- Now import it in Body component and wrap it around the RestaurantCard component.

```js
import RestaurantCard, { withPromotedLabel } from "./RestaurantCard";

const RestaurantCardPromoted = withPromotedLabel(RestaurantCard);

{
  restaurant?.isPromoted ? (
    <RestaurantCardPromoted key={resId} resData={restaurant} />
  ) : (
    <RestaurantCard key={resId} resData={restaurant} />
  );
}
```

```js
export const withPromotedLabel = (RestaurantCard) => {
  return (props) => {
    return (
      <div className="relative">
        <div className="absolute top-0 left-0 bg-rose-500 text-white p-1 rounded-br-md text-xs">
          <span>Promoted</span>
        </div>
        <RestaurantCard {...props} />
      </div>
    );
  };
};
```

- Also added props to the new withPromotedLabel and passed it to the RestaurantCard component. This is because we are passing props to the RestaurantCard component from the Body component. If we donâ€™t pass the props, the RestaurantCard component will not receive the props from the Body component.
